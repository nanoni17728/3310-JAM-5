# A Nokia 3310 gamejam??

https://itch.io/jam/nokiajam5, that’s what a friend sent me. Fully knowing it
would nerd snipe me. And nerd sniped I got!

I LOVE embedded and restricted hardware. I spent quite some time toying with
the original Gameboy, one of the hardware I love the most. Of course I would
love working on a game that would feat the restrictions of the 3310! However
I have a different approach in mind than just using a generic game engine.

I just talked about how I do stuff on the Gameboy. That means I *really* do
stuff that works on a actual, real Gameboy. I would like it to be the same
for the game I would make for this gamejam! That’s what really motivates me.

Sadly with a quick look at Google there isn’t that much informations around
the original hardware and no real emulator available. So making a game run
on a real 3310, even if doable, is out of the scope of the jam.

This isn’t too much of a problem though. As long as I keep in mind the
constraints of the 3310, I can design an engine that mimics the most 
important restrictions and make a game with it. I want to work on the
engine part more than the game part so I might not even have a submission
in the end. But that’s okay.

That’s the way I want things to go :)
